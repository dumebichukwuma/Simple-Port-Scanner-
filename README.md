# 🔎 Python GUI Port Scanner

A multithreaded TCP port scanner built with Python and CustomTkinter.  
This tool scans a target host for open TCP ports within a specified range and displays results in a graphical interface with a live progress bar.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ TCP Connect Port Scanning  
- ✅ Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
- ✅ Real-time Progress Bar  
- ✅ Multithreading (keeps UI responsive)  
- ✅ Input Validation (IP + port range)  
- ✅ Service Name Detection for Common Ports  
- ✅ Scan Time Display

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- socket – Network connections  
- threading – Background scanning  
- time – Scan duration tracking  
- customtkinter – Modern GUI  

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Install Python 3.10 or higher  
2. Install CustomTkinter:

```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python portscanner.py
```

---

## 🖥 How It Works

1. The user enters:
   - Target IP address or hostname
   - First port
   - Last port

2. The program:
   - Validates input
   - Resolves hostname to IP address
   - Scans each port using TCP `connect_ex`
   - Updates the progress bar in real time
   - Displays open ports with detected services

3. After completion:
   - Displays total scan duration
   - Shows all discovered open ports

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with TCP sockets  
- Handling concurrency using threading  
- Updating GUI elements safely using `root.after`  
- Tracking execution time  
- Designing a functional desktop interface

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add UDP scanning  
- Implement thread pool for better performance  
- Add export-to-file functionality  
- Add a Stop Scan button  
- Add colored output for open ports  
- Add logging system
